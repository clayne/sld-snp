		"hint_maxConsecutiveFailures" :  "Maximum consecutive failures before automatically succeeding. Default 3. Set to 0 for unlimited failures. Not recommended for use with option to learn multiple spells at once - script counts only total failures, not per-spell. Defaults to 3."
		"hint_autoNoviceLearning" :  "Required skill difference to always succeed when learning spells. At 0, no difference is required - e.g. Apprentice Destruction means you'll never fail at learning Apprentice and Novice spells. At 25, an Apprentice of Destruction will only never fail at learning Novice spells. Defaults to 50."
		"hint_noviceLearningEnabled" :  "When enabled, the difference between your skill in a school and the level of the spell you're trying to learn can result in an automatic success. The required difference to ensure this success is configurable below. Defaults to on."

		"hint_dreadstareLethality" :  "The chance to be killed when consuming Dreadmilk while addicted. Shadowmilk is 1/4 as lethal. Default is 10%. Also increases by your bloodstream toxicity,  which increases 10% every time you consume Dreadmilk and decreases with rest."

		"hint_bonusScale" :  "Multiplier applied to the roleplaying bonus to chance of learning/discovering. This means casting spells relevant to your study, hoarding relevant spell notes,  sleeping at the College and temples,  consuming shadowmilk,  etc. Default is 1.0. Raising this can make it unreasonably easy to learn spells."

		"hint_infoSchool" :  "Current magical school of interest."
		"hint_collectNotes" :  "Whether or not to deconstruct removed books into scraps. Keeping a large collection of spell notes improves the roleplaying bonus for spell learning chance. Scraps are equal in value to the book. Default is enabled."
		"hint_removeBooks" :  "Whether or not to remove spell books from inventory when added, to prevent vanilla 'insta-learn'. Default is enabled. Disabling this may cause errors if the mod tries to teach you a spell you learn with a second book."
		"hint_preferedSchool" :  "Set this to the school of magic you want to discover spells from. Default is Automatic, which uses your most cast school from that day."

		"hint_enthir" :  "Whether or not Enthir will keep a stock of items related to this mod. Default is yes."
		"hint_studyInterval" :  "Whether or not items are added to loot lists, causing them to spawn in random merchants and as loot. Defaults to no. Cannot be easily undone."
		"hint_tooDifficultDiff" :  "The difference in skill tier required to automatically fail learning. Default is 75 - a novice will automatically fail to learn expert+ level spells."
		"hint_tooDiffEnabled" :  "When enabled,  you can automatically fail to learn a spell if it's significantly above your current skill level. In this case you will automatically move to the next possible spell without penalty."
		"hint_deletionWarning" :  "WARNING: Disabling mod will clear your spell list! Use backups!"
		"hint_potionBypass" :  "When enabled,  Dreadmilk will bypass enabled skill requirements. For example, with dreadmilk a novice can attempt to learn a Master spell even when they would otherwise be prevented from doing so. Defaults to on."
		"hint_cdrEnabled" :  "When enabling this,  casting spells etc will not only increase your chance to learn spells,  but will also reduce the cooldown between learnings. Defaults to on."
		"hint_cdr" :  "The maximum percentage by which the cooldown can be reduced through practice by casting up to 100 spells. Defaults to 25%."
		"hint_maxFailsSucceeds" :  "When enabled,  reaching the maximum failure limit will cause you to succeed as long as it isn't prevented by something like the skill difference option. When off, the spell will be moved to the bottom of your list instead. Defaults to on."
		"hint_dynamicDiff" :  "When enabled,  the chance to learn a spell also depends on its own difficulty relative to your skill. Defaults to on."
